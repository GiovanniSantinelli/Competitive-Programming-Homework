/*
The solution is based on the fenwick tree. First we remap values to their rank in the sorted array in order to have values in the range
[1..n]. Then we scan the vector from right the left and fill a vector suffix_counter such that suffix_counter[i] = f(i, n, v). 
In the same loop we build the BIT B in order to have B[i] = the number of elements in suffix_counter equal to i. 
This means that B.sum(k) gives the number of time f(i, n, v[i]) < k.
Now we traverse v from left to right. When we are processing v[i] we can observe that we can easily compute f(1, i, v[i]) 
by using the counter vector. If f(1, i, v[i]) = k, we have to count the number of indices j such that f(j, n, v[i]) < k and this 
is sum(k-i) on the fenwick tree, but actually to get the answer we have to consider only those indices j that are bigger than i, so we
 have to remove the values suffix_counter[1..i]. This is done step by step by subtracting 1 from B[suffix_counter[i]].
 Time complexity is O(n log n).
